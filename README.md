# SuperDuperCalculator

Developed a calculator using data structures.

Apart of a school assignment.

I had to create a calculator using data structures.

The idea is to emulate the programming of a Ti-83 calculator.

You can type (4 + 3 + (4   +  6) ) and you will get the correct answer.

Still needs some cleanup.

Thanks,
Ken
